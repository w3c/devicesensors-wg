        DAS WG virtual meeting at TPAC 2020 (22-23 October 2020)

<p>
    As defined in its <a href=
    "https://www.w3.org/2020/11/das-wg-charter.html">charter</a>,
    the mission of the <em>Devices and Sensors Working Group</em>
    (DAS WG) is to create secure and privacy-preserving client-side APIs
    that enable the development of web applications that interact with
    device capabilities. See the <a href="roadmap">roadmap</a> for details.
</p>
<p>
    The Working Group aims at gathering consensus on its specifications,
    both within the Working Group and with the community at large, working
    through an iterative process with implementors to ensure that the
    specifications are implementable and implemented. See also the <a href=
    "https://www.w3.org/Mobile/roadmap/">Roadmap of Web Applications on
    Mobile</a> on how this work fits in with the broader context of the
    Web platform.
